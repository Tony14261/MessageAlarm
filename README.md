# Message Alarm <br>
## Information
### What does it do? <br>
First, you will set a message and the time. When your computer time is at your set time (the time you set earlier), there will be a sign appear at your screen, saying the message you wanted to. (get the idea the name is 'Message Alarm'?) <br>
### How to use it <br>
Just as I said, you have to type in your message and time (24-hour time). Then you have to keep the program running (it won't cost many CPU becasue it just check every 0.5 secs). If the program's not working or you want to stop it, press Ctrl+C to stop it (please report to Github if it does). <br>
