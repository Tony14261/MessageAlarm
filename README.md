# Message Alarm <br>

## Information
### What does it do? <br>
First, you will set a message and the time. When your computer time is at your set time (the time you set earlier), there will be a sign appear on your screen, saying the message you wanted to. (get the idea tis project's name is 'Message Alarm'?) <br>
### How to use it <br>
Just as I said, you have to type in your message and time (24-hour time). And if you want your message to break line, type `\n` in your message input. Then you have to keep the program running (it won't cost many CPU becasue it just check every 0.5 secs). <br>
If the program's not working or you want to stop it, press Ctrl+C (in the console) to stop it (please report to Github if it does). Another way is force End Task in Task Manager. <br>
